## Possible issues
During conversion, two errors occur after running the convert command:

```
convert-im6.q16: not authorized `multiple_img.pdf' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/412.
convert-im6.q16: no images defined `output-%3d.jpg' @ error/convert.c/ConvertImageCommand/3258.
```

For the first error, you can edit ```/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml``` and change the following line:

```commandline
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
```

to 
```commandline
<policy domain="coder" rights="read|write" pattern="PDF" />
```

For the second error, this is because ghostscript has not been installed on the system. Try to install it:

```commandline
apt install ghostscript

```

# how to use:
```
python main.py -l path/to/file.csv -t "path/to/file.pptx"
```
